# Box-Shooter
Unity Based Shooter Game - Intro to Game Development, by Michigan State University

I Created this as a part of an online game development course by Michigan State University.

ALL ASSETS AND CODE WERE PROVIDED AND/OR PART OF THE COURSE BY MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY.
THIS IS ONLY BEING UPLOADED TO SHOWCASE MY FAMILIARITY WITH THE UNITY GAME ENGINE.
All credits go to Michigan State University for creating the course and all provided materials.

The Game:
The player is stationary but is able to turn their camera by moving their mouse.
Several different colored boxes will continuously spawn around the player.
The player should aim at the boxes and then, shoot them.

UPON STARTING: 
The player will have 0 points and a timer will begin counting down at the top of their screen.
The player must start shooting boxes.
Once the timer runs out, it is game over

THE BOXES:
1. GREEN - This will award the player points
2. WHITE - This will add time to the countdown at the top of the players screen
3. ORANGE - This will subtract time from the countdown at the top of the players screen.

I have also modified this and exported it to Android Studio:
I implemented a level system, where upon reaching a certain numbner of points, you can move on to the next level.
In each level it will get harder, the goal to reach will be higher, you may have less time or the box weights will be altered, the higher you go, the more orange boxes will spawn, and less of the green/white ones.
After reaching a certain point, it will enter into an endless mode where the player will just go as long as possible

Android version Issues:
If the user uses both fingers to aim, the camera will act unpredictably.

I will include the most recent version, prior to exporting it to Android Studio.
